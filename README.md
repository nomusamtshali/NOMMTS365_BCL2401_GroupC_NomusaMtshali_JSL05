# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator

# Project Overview

- In this project, I combined my knowledge of JavaScript arrays and the `map()` function to create a personalized "Awesome Mix" playlist for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. My task was to filter and organize songs based on each Guardian's musical preference, displaying a playlist tailored just for them.

# Elements Included

- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

- Throughout this project, there were many new things I learnt and most of them are still a bit confusing to me, which is why I believe there are no areas of mastery regarding the map() function as an array method.

## Challenges Faced

- Throughout this project, there were many challenges that I faced, most of them being debugging issues. One major issue I faced during the process was figuring out the proper syntax for a map() function, this challenge set me back a long while as I tried to find a solution. Another big challenge I faced a was when I wanted to display the playlist, and simply could not figure out how to code a solution that fits.

## Areas of Improvement

- Using descriptive variable names: I need to start using more meaningful variable names that describe what the variable is used for as this will make my code easier to read and understand.
- I could start handling errors properly by logging them as this will help me to debug any issue that could arise.

# Overall Learning Experience

- I found learning about JavaScript arrays and the map() function to be a valuable experience. I want to check out other built-in array methods like "reduce()", "every()", and "some()", as well as learning about advanced features. I believe that the more I practice and code, the more I'll learn and grow as a developer.
